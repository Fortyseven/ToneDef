# ToneDef

ToneDef is a small, but powerful tone dialer application for Android featuring [DTMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling), [blue box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_box), and [red box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_box_(phreaking)) tone generation.

Use the keypad, enter a predefined sequence, or select an entry from your contact list.

There are other tone generators on the market, but when I really needed one... well... I was left with the urge to write my own. Hopefully this one works out for you, too. üòéü•É

# NOTE
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **ToneDef is currently not in active development.** ‚ö†Ô∏è
>
> I no longer create or work on native mobile projects on my own time. Bug reports and feature requests are not being processed. While I reserve the right to continue work on this version of the app at some point, it is far more likely that I'll put that effort into an HTML5/Svelte port of it. (With the advantage of being able to run on any nearly platform, not just Android.) When and if that happens, I'll update this document to reflect that. -- 2023-01-02
