ToneDef
=======
ToneDef is a small, but powerful tone dialer application for Android featuring [DTMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling), [blue box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_box), and [red box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_box_(phreaking)) tone generation. 

Use the keypad, enter a predefined sequence, or select an entry from your contact list.

There are other tone generators on the market, but when I really needed one... well... I was left with the urge to write my own. Hopefully this one works out for you, too. ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¥ƒ
